# Loadbalancer

## Install

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-elk.yml -f docker-compose-influx.yml up -d --build
```

## Purpose

### Advantages

## Design

### Main layer
	
- **Nginx** used as a proxy
- (**Dockgergen**)[https://github.com/jwilder/dockergen]
	- Creates nginx configuration automatically for containers. All it needs is a `VIRTUAL_HOST` environment varialble
- **Letsencrypt**
	- Automatically enables HTTPS on a container when the `LETSENCRYPT_HOST` and `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` environment variables are present.

###Â Logging

Logging is done in two ways,  using the ELK (elasticsearch) stack and using TICK (influxdata) stack. 

The two stacks measure different data. The first gives access to logs from all the containers while the second shows the impact each container has on the server resources.

### ELK

The ELK stack includes:

- Kibana
- Elasticsearch
- Logstash

Two more containers were added:

- `logspout`: Automatically catches logs from containers and pushes them to **Logstash**
- `elk_starter`: Configures elasticsearch for kibana and logstash and sets an index.

> Kibana (with x-pack enabled) offers authentication. It is set by default to:

> u: elastic 
> p: changeme

> u: kibana
> p: changeme

These users can be changed later from Kibana

### TICK

The TICK stack includes the following containers:

- Telegraf
- Chronograf
- Influxdb
- Kapacitor

It is configured to handle inputs both from the host system and from the docker socket to monitor all the containers.

>> Chronograf can be configured to use github authentication

### Usage

You can use the full solution or combine parts of it.

- To install just the proxy (with letsencrypt) run 

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

- To install the proxy and ELK use:

```
docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-elk.yml -d --build
```

- Finally to install the proxy with just TICK run:

```
docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-influx.yml -d --build
```

- To install everything run the following instead:

```
docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-elk.yml -f docker-compose-influx.yml -d --build
```

>> If you want to use TICK or ELK, you must start from the `proxy` yml, because they both use networks defined in docker-compose.yml. docker-compose-elk.yml and docker-compose-influx.yml extend docker-compose.yml

## Requirements



## Todo

- IP Filtering
- Canary testing
- Build letsencrypt without dockergen since we're using an external dockergen container

## Updating

InfluxData (TICK) stalk: 1.3-alpine
ElasticSearch (ELK) stalk: 6.2.0 (x-pack enabled)
Dockergen: jwilder/dockergen:latest
Letsencrypt: 
- Dockergen: 0.7.3
- Alpine: 3.3
Nginx: 1.13

All the containers (where possible) are based on Alpine
